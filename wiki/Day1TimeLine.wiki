Player (Alexander Christopher) starts of in a cabin, by Millers Lake.

Cinematic of Player Tinkering with radio - Radio talks about outbreak.


<br>
Start walking to the Forester.

Come by a cliff, but ass you scale your way down you fall, knocking yourself out (Black screen).

Wake up and continue walking(Slower as your hurt).

Almost at the Foresters, hear zombies closing in.


<br>
Finally get to the Foresters hut/cabin.

See the Foresters car crashed into a tree.

Walk inside to find the Forester looking very pale with wound on his arm. (More explained in journal)

The Forester tells you he'll tell you all he knows if you go up and get his journal for you.

Go up stairs and get the Foresters Journal - Get hit/infected. Kill the zombified Forester.

Read Journal to find out what happend and also that there is a cure (Rare plants, that just so happen to grow scarcely in your area).


<br>
Go out and find ingredients(Still aren't totally sure on how were going to implement this)
