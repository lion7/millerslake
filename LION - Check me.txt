Made a weapon_mauser.cpp file @ src\game\shared\hl2mp

Still need to ask blob how many bullets ti carries so that we know how many shells to create on reload.
Also if it can be reloaded Singly (As in add 1 bullet then fire rather)

I didn't add it to the solution yet.

Seen it's a bolt action we may Have to add in another animation for pulling the bolt back after each fire. 
Should take a look into the way the shotgun does the pump.

Btw, Problems is epic:P
