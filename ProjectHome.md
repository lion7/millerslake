Millers Lake is a mod based on the source engine that’s currently in development.
The idea is that in a town there was a mill that was closed down, and the character you’re playing got fired from that mill. The character decided to take a break and rented a wooden cabin in the forest for a while. The area is known as an place where a lot of bears and other dangerous wildlife is found. During the character’s break in the forest a zombie virus spreads trough the world. Eventually the character gets a radio working and hears that most big cities are swarmed with zombies. However, most small villages still remain unharmed and should start collecting weapons as the zombies are on their way to infect those villages too. The character decides to go to the town and help the people to defend against the zombie outbreak. When the character leaves the cabin and wants to go on his/her way to the town, screaming zombies are heard in the distance. This is where the game begins.
