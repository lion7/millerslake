<br>
Start walking to the Forester.<br>
<br>
Come by a cliff, but ass you scale your way down you fall, knocking yourself out (Black screen).<br>
<br>
Wake up and continue walking(Slower as your hurt).<br>
<br>
Almost at the Foresters, hear zombies closing in.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Finally get to the Foresters hut/cabin.<br>
<br>
See the Foresters car crashed into a tree.<br>
<br>
Walk inside to find the Forester looking very pale with wound on his arm. (More explained in journal)<br>
<br>
The Forester tells you he'll tell you all he knows if you go up and get his journal for you.<br>
<br>
Go up stairs and get the Foresters Journal - Get hit/infected. Kill the zombified Forester.<br>
<br>
Read Journal to find out what happend and also that there is a cure (Rare plants, that just so happen to grow scarcely in your area).<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Go out and find ingredients(Still aren't totally sure on how were going to implement this)<br>
